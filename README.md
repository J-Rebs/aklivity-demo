This reposistory is a work in progress. It will be noted when it is complete here. 

This is a demo app for Aklivity Zilla built on top of the example todo service from Aklivity to create a secondary chart-app that allows realtime rendering of poll data.

The todo app and todo service come directly from Aklivity's demo. You can find it [here](https://docs.aklivity.io/zilla/get-started/build-todo-app).

Comments are included throughout the Svelte 'chart-app' to help understand how Zilla helps make deploying applications using the power of Apache Kafka easier. 

Zilla lets you focus on what happens when data reaches point A or B not how you are going to get it between point A and B. Using Zilla for the first time is 
kind of like the first time you learned how to use pipes on a command line interface like BASH; you'll open up a whole new world of possibilites.
